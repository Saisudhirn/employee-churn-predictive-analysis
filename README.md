# employee-churn-predictive-analysis
In this notebook I would be using a fictional data set, provided by the IBM (https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/ibm-hr-analytics-employee-attrition-performance) to predict an Employee's risk of quitting based on various factors. The dataset consists of 34 features - Age, Attrition, BusinessTravel, DailyRate, Department, DistanceFromHome, Education, EducationField, EmployeeCount, EmployeeNumber, EnvironmentSatisfaction, Gender, HourlyRate, JobInvolvement, JobLevel, JobRole, JobSatisfaction, MaritalStatus, MonthlyIncome, MonthlyRate, NumCompaniesWorked, Over18, OverTime, PercentSalaryHike, PerformanceRating, RelationshipSatisfaction, StandardHours, StockOptionLevel, TotalWorkingYears, TrainingTimesLastYear, WorkLifeBalance, YearsAtCompany, YearsInCurrentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion and YearsWithCurrManager.<br/>
In case of predicting the Employee churn Recall would carry more weighted in terms of cost as if our model predicts falsely that an employee is not going to churn we would not be taking proactive measure and the company would eventually lose out on good talent. It would generally cost more to hire new telent than to retain good telent in the company where as if the model falsely predicts that an employee is going to chrun and the management is taking proactive measures to ratain that emplyee, it may be an extra cost to the company but this added cost is not more than the cost of accuring new talent. Addionally taking proactive efforts on employees who are not likely to churn might also increase the moral of the employees. Hence I would be hyper tuning my models to achive high recall score.
